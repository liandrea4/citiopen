export const cut = (
  <DialogContentText>
    This page allows you to categorize ballkids into various cut categories.
    <br /> <br />
    The Active Ballkids section only includes ballkids that are active this year
    and not yet cut. The list is organized with rookies at the top of the list,
    captains at the bottom of the list, and ascending order of years of
    experience.
    <br /> <br />
    The cut sections (Definitely Keep, Possibly Keep, Possibly Cut, and
    Definitely Cut) are not publicly visible to ballkids and captains and can be
    treated as a working space.
    <br /> <br />
    In order to actually cut one or more ballkid(s) such that the cut is
    publicly visible by ballkids and captains, move the ballkid to either the
    Possibly Cut or Definitely Cut sections. From there, you can either cut the
    whole cut category (via the "Cut All" button) or cut individual ballkids
    (via the red octogonal X icon). The gray X icon removes the ballkid from the
    cut section and moves them back into the Active Ballkids section.

    <br /> <br />
    Cut ballkids are ballkids which were active this year (signed up) but have
    already been cut from the tournament.
    <br /> <br />
    Archived ballkids are ballkids from previous years which did not sign up to
    ballkid this year. To view active, non-cut ballkids, go to the List By Name
    page (List &gt; By Name).

    the teams. Toggling to "Show" will make all teams publicly visible for
    ballkids and captains to view.
    <br /> <br />
    The Unassigned section lists all checked in and unassigned ballkids.
    Ballkids are listed with chairpeople on top, followed by captains, followed
    by descending number of years of experience, with rookies at the bottom. A
    red circle (as opposed to a green circle) indicates the ballkid is an
    out-of-town rookie. The "Check Out All" button will check out all unassigned
    ballkids.
    <br /> <br />
    On desktop, the Unassigned section has separate lists for Nets and Backs,
    where Switches will ONLY show up in the section for their preferred
    position. Once assigned to a team, a switch can be switched to the other
    position. To create teams, drag and drop a ballkid from the Unassigned
    section to the "New Team" box. This will automatically create a new team.
    Continue constructing teams by dragging and dropping ballkids from the
    Unassigned section to either an existing or a new team. The "Clear" button
    on a team will clear the team and unassign (although not check out) the
    whole team. The "Check Out All" button on a team will clear the team and
    check out the whole team. Switches can be switched from a back to a net, or
    vice versa. The gray X icon will unassign a particular ballkid from a team.
    <br /> <br />
    On mobile, to create teams, click the corresponding button in the Unassigned
    section to either create a new team or assign a ballkid to an existing team.
    Ballkids in the Unassigned section on mobile are not split into separate Net
    and Back sections, and instead are listed out (chairpeople, followed by
    captains, followed by descending number of years experience) with the
    preferred position listed.
    <br /> <br />
    Teams that are currently on court will be highlighted green, with the
    current court assignment listed. Teams that are not currently on court will
    indicate their next upcoming court assignment, or "No more shifts" if they
    do not have any more upcoming shifts.

    non-finals team. Ballkids are listed with chairpeople on top, followed by

    If there are no shifts found for the selected date, you can create a default
    schedule based on the inputted parameters. When creating the schedule, the
    correct courts will automatically be chosen based on the number of courts
    inputted (e.g. indicating 4 courts will choose all courts except for Court
    5, indicating 3 courts will choose all courts excpet for Courts 4 and 5,
    etc.).
    <br /> <br />
    If there are shifts found for the selected date, you can view and edit the
    schedule. When editing the schedule, you can update which team is assigned
    to which court at what hour, add and delete hours, add and delete courts,
    and change court names. To change a team assignment, enter edit mode and
    enter the desired team in the corresponding cell; team changes are
    auto-saved. To add a court, enter edit mode and click the right + icon on
    the far right of the table. To change a court name, enter edit mode, enter
    the desired court name, and hit ENTER to save. To delete a court, enter edit
    mode, delete the court name, and hit ENTER to save. To add or delete an
    hour, enter edit mode and click the corresponding +/- icon at the bottom of
    the table; this will add or remove an hour at the end of the current
    schedule.
    <br /> <br />
    The schedule can be shifted up or down by 1 hour increments. You need to be
    in view mode (not edit mode) to be able to shift the schedule.
    <br /> <br />
    The schedule can also be deleted for the day. This enables you to recreate a
    default schedule with inputted parameters.
